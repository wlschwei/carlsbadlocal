                <a href="https://www.surfline.com/surf-report/tamarack/5842041f4e65fad6a7708837">SURFLINE Tamarack Surf Report & Forecast</a>
                <p>Tamarack beach expands a long stretch down the Pacific Coast Highway with a popular boardwalk alongside it. Tamarack beach is a popular tourist destination due to its large parking lot and proximity to the main roads. It’s easy beach access
                    makes it crowded on hot summer days. Tamarack has beach volleyball courts that attract players of all levels. Along Tamarack beach you will find runners, bikers, walkers, surfers, kite surfers, kite flyers, drone flyers and more! Locals
                    will surf Tamarack at when the shorebreak is pumping, but usually know to avoid this beach due to its high volume of tourists. If you’re a tourist looking for a more “local” experience in Carlsbad, check out some of the other beaches.</p>

                <h3>North Ponto</h3>
                <a href="https://www.surfline.com/surf-report/ponto-north/584204214e65fad6a7709c79">SURFLINE Ponto North Surf Report & Forecast</a>
                <p>North Ponto is a popular spot for surfers in the early morning and sunset viewers in the evening. Its elevated location makes for scenic pictures at sunset and you will be able to catch a part of the beautiful cliffs along the coast. North
                    Ponto has a small parking lot, so busy times can be stressful in finding a spot. Be prepared to do a few loops or wait a bit before finding a spot during the summer time. North Ponto offers a great break and accommodates surfers of
                    all levels. Be careful of the tide pools below this spot and low tide can cause some rocks to appear. This beach is not as touristy as others, so come here for a more relaxing stay. However, the sand beach is smaller so high tide often
                    causes the beach to be engulfed. You'll surely find some Carlsbad Kooks at North Ponto.</p>

                <h3>Warm Waters Jetty</h3>
                <a href="http://www.surfline.com/surfdata/report_google.cfm?id=4774&sef=true">SURFLINE Warm Waters Jetty Break Map</a>
                <p>Although no longer a jetty due to recent construction, Warm Water Jetty is a popular spot for locals. Named after the warm water from the Encina Power Plant emitting warm water into the area, Warm Waters used to be a popular surf spot
                    in the winter time when the water was much warmer than other spots. Now, Warm Waters is still a popular surfing spot but also accommodates many family activities and bonfires. Warm Waters beach is located near Tamarack and has ample
                    parking space along the PCH, your parallel parking skills will definitely be improved after visiting this beach! With speculation about the power plant being torn down, Warm Waters will still live on as a special spot to Carlsbad surfers.</p>

                <p>Terra Mar, coming from the Latin words for earth and sea, is a gorgeous mix of seaside cliffs and stunning waves. Sometimes the tide pools will make an appearance here during extremely low tides, which attracts both locals and tourists!
                    Located under the Carlsbad Cliffs, Terra Mar is tucked away and far from easy beach access, making it a “locals only” type of beach. It is common to find sunset viewers and photographers on the cliffs of Terra Mar as the views are
                    breathtaking. The mansions along the cliffs above Terra Mar are anyone's dream home. Terra Mar beach is a very popular surf spot in San Diego and is known to have great lefts. Be careful of rocks and tide pools that may be underneath
                    you when swimming or surfing in this area. Also don't be alarmed if you smell a fishy smell when driving past Terra Mar beach.</p>

                <p>South Ponto is an expansive sandy beach located in south Carlsbad on the border of Carlsbad & Encinitas. South Ponto has a huge parking lot, however it’s a pay lot. There is limited free parking spots, but be careful not to get your car
                    stuck in the sand! South Ponto is home to the Carlsbad Junior Lifeguards, so be careful during summer months not to visit during session time. South Ponto is the best beach to hold bonfires at night, but come early to grab a pit during
                    the summer months! This beach is extremely kid friendly and is a popular spot for tourists.</p>

                <a href="https://www.californiabeaches.com/beach/robert-frazee-state-beach/">More Info On Robert C. Frazee State Beach</a>
                <p>Robert C. Frazee Beach, commonly known as “Reds” by the locals, is a popular spot near the village of Carlsbad. Reds is home to beach volleyball courts that are a hot commodity during the summer months. Adult volleyball leagues practice
                    here and tourists can come watch how the locals play! Reds beach is a touristy beach due to its location near downtown Carlsbad and prevalent beach access. This beach is great for families and has showers and bathrooms nearby. There
                    is a small parking lot above the beach and other parking along the side streets. During hot days parking can be a struggle. Reds Beach is bordered by beach resorts and private homes. You may find some surfers here but it is mostly
                    filled with swimmers and boogie boarders.</p>

                <p>Beach access can be found on Ocean street or Beech street. Although this beach isn't officially named "Army Navy", it is known as that by the locals due to the Amry and Navy Academy being alonside this beach. There are various staircases
                    to access this beach and parking is sometimes tricky as you have to find a spot on the side streets. However, once you access this beach you will find it to be tourist-free and made up of mostly locals who know the spot. This beach
                    has lots of shells in the sand if you like to collect them. The conditions aren't the best for surfing here and it is unlikely that you see anyone attempting to surf at this spot. I recommend this beach if you are looking for a quieter
                    beach during busy season.</p>

                <h3>Campgrounds (South Carlsbad State Beach)</h3>
                <a href="http://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/South-Carlsbad-State-Beach">South Carlsbad State Beach Surf Report</a>
                <p>South Carlsbad State Beach is referred by locals as "Campgrounds" due to its location below the Carlsbad State Beach Campgrounds. The water here is always perfect for swimming and the waves are usually good for surfers. The views from
                    the campgrounds are breathtaking at sunset. The tricky thing about this beach is the parking situation. If you are not actually camping parking can be tricky. If you do have a spot at the campgrounds there are staircases leading straight
                    down to the beach. A lifeguard tower is in place so that you can feel safe while swimming or surfing. If you don't have a campgrounds here I recommend parking at the nearby shopping center and walking over. You could also park in the
                    North Ponto lot and walk over to this beach.</p>
